1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this chatbot is to provide a convenient and accessible platform for individuals to assess their mental health through casual conversation. By combining AWS hosting, advanced language models, decision tree analysis, and voice emotion recognition, the chatbot aims to detect various mental health abnormalities.

1.2 Scope
The chatbot focuses on detecting eight types of abnormalities: depression, PTSD, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, bulimia, anorexia, and OCD. It provides users with a confidential and non-judgmental environment to express their feelings and concerns.

1.3 Target Audience
The primary target audience includes individuals who may be hesitant to approach a professional but are seeking a preliminary assessment of their mental health. This chatbot does not replace professional medical advice but aims to encourage users to seek help when needed.

2. System Architecture
2.1 AWS Hosting
The chatbot is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure scalability, reliability, and security. AWS services are utilized to store data securely and handle the computational load associated with natural language processing and decision tree analysis.

2.2 RAG and LLMs for Questionnaire Generation
The chatbot employs Randomized Answer Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically generate questionnaires. This ensures a conversational and personalized interaction with users, adapting the questions based on responses.

2.3 Decision Tree Method
A decision tree algorithm is implemented to analyze user responses and determine potential mental health abnormalities. The algorithm follows a structured set of questions, branching based on user inputs, leading to the identification of specific conditions.

2.4 Voice Analysis
The chatbot incorporates voice analysis technology to assess the emotional tone of the user. By analyzing pitch, tone, and speech patterns, the chatbot enhances its understanding of the user's emotional state.

3. Workflow
3.1 User Interaction
Users engage in a natural and casual conversation with the chatbot, facilitated by RAG and LLMs. The chatbot guides users through a series of questions designed to assess their mental well-being.

3.2 Questionnaire Generation
The chatbot dynamically generates questionnaires based on user responses, adapting the conversation flow to extract relevant information related to mental health.

3.3 Decision Tree Analysis
User responses are processed through a decision tree algorithm, which analyzes the data and determines potential mental health abnormalities. The algorithm refines its predictions with each user input.

3.4 Voice Emotion Analysis
Voice analysis is performed in real-time, allowing the chatbot to gauge the emotional state of the user. This information is integrated into the overall assessment.

3.5 Conclusion Generation
By combining the results from the decision tree analysis and voice emotion analysis, the chatbot generates a conclusion regarding potential mental health abnormalities.

4. Abnormality Detection
4.1 List of Abnormalities
Depression
PTSD
Anxiety
Schizophrenia
Bipolar Disorder
Bulimia
Anorexia
OCD
4.2 Criteria for Detection
Each abnormality is associated with specific criteria within the decision tree. The chatbot identifies patterns and matches user responses to these criteria to make a preliminary assessment.

4.3 Combined Results
The final conclusion is drawn by considering both decision tree analysis and voice emotion analysis, providing a comprehensive view of the user's mental health.

5. Aid and Support
5.1 Solution Suggestions
The chatbot provides tailored suggestions for users based on their detected abnormalities. These suggestions may include self-help strategies, coping mechanisms, and encouragement to seek professional help.

5.2 User Resources

5.3 Emergency Procedures
In cases of severe distress, the chatbot guides users on emergency procedures and strongly encourages them to seek immediate professional assistance.

6. Security and Privacy
6.1 Data Handling
User data is handled with the utmost confidentiality. Information collected during the conversation is securely stored and processed, adhering to strict privacy standards.

6.2 Encryption
Communication between the user and the chatbot is encrypted to protect sensitive information. Encryption protocols are implemented to ensure the secure transmission of data.

6.3 Privacy Measures
The chatbot includes privacy features, allowing users to delete their conversation history and providing clear information about data storage and usage practices.

7. User Guidelines
7.1 Accessing the Chatbot
Users can access the chatbot through a user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless and accessible experience.

7.2 Providing Accurate Information
Users are encouraged to provide accurate and honest responses to ensure the chatbot's accurate assessment of their mental health.
